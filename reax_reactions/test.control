#because ReaxFF's connection table does not specify atom type.

#Bond cutoff. This is the lowest value in which we will consider the bond being
#a "real" bond. Any BO below this will be disregarded. The cutoff is useful in
#excluding hydrogen bonds from being processed when determining what the
#"molecule" is for a given atom.
